## parts of OOP

object literal

- Constructor function
- prototypes
- Instances (new, this)

## 4 pillars

- Abstraction (dtails hide (fetch))
- Encapsulation (wrap data)
- inheritance (inherite parent to child some method)
- polymorhism

Notes:
new:-

1. When we use the new keyword, it creates a new empty object. This object is called an instance object.

2. The constructor function is called using the new keyword.

3. All arguments passed during the call are injected (assigned) to the new object.

4. We get access to the values and properties inside the function using this.
